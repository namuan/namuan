# Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation - Byrne Hobart, Tobias Huber

> Challenges the conventional view of speculative bubbles as purely destructive economic phenomena. Instead, it argues that, under the right conditions, bubbles can function as powerful accelerators of innovation, propelling societies out of stagnation and into periods of rapid progress.

## Notes:

* Technological innovation is more driven by excess, exuberance, and irrationality than by cost-benefit analyses, rational calculation, and careful and deliberate planning. Reality-bending delusions are underrated drivers of techno-economic progress.
* In other words, a necessary enabling condition for technological progress, which ultimately fuels human flourishing, is what the Ancient Greeks called *thymos*, which often gets translated as 'spiritedness'—a relentless drive to transcend the limitations of a listless present.
* Crucially, such bubbles decouple investment from purely rational, backward-looking expectations of economic return, which correspondingly reduces risk aversion. Therein lies our escape from the Great Stagnation.
* Instead of mastering uncertainty and embracing ambiguity, we quantify risk in hopes of eliminating it. This zero-risk bias not only impedes innovation, it can backfire.
* The quantification of scientific productivity—its reduction to a simple and clean metric—rewards conformity and cultivates risk aversion.
* Spreadsheets and machine-learning algorithms, trained on what has come before, dictate what gets made based on what has worked in the past.
* Because ads, search, and social media are all optimized for popularity and engineered for virality, desires and opinions converge on whatever consensus dominates the echo chamber.
* In an inflection-driven bubble, investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.
* The fundamental utility of inflection bubbles comes from their role as coordinating mechanisms. When one group makes investments predicated on a particular vision of the future, it reduces the risk for others seeking to build parts of that vision.
* Bubbles also offer a partial escape from the trap of constantly comparing oneself to others. According to René Girard’s theory of mimetic desire, recently popularized among the Silicon Valley set by Peter Thiel, our wants tend to be borrowed from other people. We want not what we desire on our own but what we think *other* people desire.
* A product that’s twice as expensive as its identical competitor isn’t viable, but a product that’s twice as expensive and getting 10 percent cheaper every year will eventually dominate the market.
* A bubble reveals a definitive vision of what could be, a future that breaks with the contemporary order of things. In a bubble, the future causally affects the present.
* Investments can vaporize in an instant, but the memory of being part of a tiny band of people trying to change the world, and feeling for a time like it’s succeeding, is timeless.
* ... any domain of future transformative progress remains necessarily vague and under-defined, and the more granular and concrete the analysis becomes, the greater the risk of over-indexing on cases and examples that might turn out to be historically irrelevant.
* Today, a lack of transcendent vision is the ultimate source of the crisis of meaning and the techno-economic and cultural stagnation that inflicts the West.
