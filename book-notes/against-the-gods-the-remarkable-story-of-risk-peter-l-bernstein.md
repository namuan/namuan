# Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk - Peter L. Bernstein

> With the stock market breaking records almost daily, leaving longtime market analysts shaking their heads and revising their forecasts, a study of the concept of risk seems quite timely. Peter Bernstein has written a comprehensive history of man's efforts to understand risk and probability, beginning with early gamblers in ancient Greece, continuing through the 17th-century French mathematicians Pascal and Fermat and up to modern chaos theory. Along the way he demonstrates that understanding risk underlies everything from game theory to bridge-building to winemaking.

## Notes

* "Fear of harm ought to be proportional not merely to the gravity of the harm, but also to the probability of the event."  Highlights the idea that both the severity of a potential negative outcome and its likelihood should influence decisions, which was a major innovation in thinking about risk.

* "the value of an item must not be based on its price, but rather on the utility that it yields."  Introduces the concept of utility, which suggests that the subjective value or satisfaction derived from something is more important than its objective price, a foundational concept for decision-making.

* "[A]tho' Chance produces Irregularities, still the Odds will be infinitely great, that in process of Time, those Irregularities will bear no proportion to recurrency of that Order which naturally results from ORIGINAL DESIGN."  de Moivre emphasizes that despite random fluctuations, there is an underlying order that emerges over time, which is critical to understanding probability and statistical analysis.

* "Any approach to scientific inference which seeks to legitimise an answer in response to complex uncertainty is, for me, a totalitarian parody of a would-be rational learning process."  Expresses skepticism about the ability of statistical methods to resolve complex uncertainties, highlighting the limitations of such tools when dealing with unique events.

* "The greater the number of individuals observed, the more do peculiarities, whether physical or moral, become effaced, and allow the general facts to predominate, by which society exists and is preserved."  Illustrates the idea of the "average man" which is an important concept in statistics and social science, suggesting that when observing a large group, the overall trends become more significant than individual variations.

* "The mathematical expectation of the speculator is zero."  Highlights a key idea from Bachelier's thesis on speculation and probability, suggesting that on average, speculators do not profit from their activities.

* "It is meaningless and fatally misleading to speak of the probability, in an objective sense, that a judgment is correct."  Knight emphasizes a distinction between risk, which can be measured with probabilities, and uncertainty, where the probabilities themselves are not knowable, a key concept in understanding decision-making in complex environments.

* "We can assemble big pieces of information and little pieces, but we can never get all the pieces together. We never know for sure how good our sample is."  Summarizes the challenges in making judgements under uncertainty and the role that information quality plays in this process.

* "Investment management is not art, not science, it's engineering.... We are in the business of managing and engineering financial investment risk."  Emphasizes the practical application of quantitative methods in modern investment management, treating risk management as a form of engineering that can be measured and optimized.

* "I was struck with the notion that you should be interested in risk as well as return."  Markowitz captures the shift from simply measuring returns to including risk as an essential factor in investment decisions.

* "There is a relation between the evidence and the event considered, but it is not necessarily measurable."  Keynes indicates that while there is a relationship between evidence and outcomes, it is not always possible to measure this relationship with statistical analysis.
