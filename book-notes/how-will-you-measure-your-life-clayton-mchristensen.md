## Notes:

- incentives are not the same as motivation. True motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it. This type of motivation continues, in good times and in bad.
- I had thought the destination was what was important, but it turned out it was the journey.
- We should always remember that beyond a certain point, hygiene factors such as money, status, compensation, and job security are much more a by-product of being happy with a job rather than the cause of it.
- though he is poor, his life is rich in friendships.
- I genuinely believe that relationships with family and close friends are one of the greatest sources of happiness in life. It sounds simple, but like any important investment, these relationships need consistent attention and care.
- But there are two forces that will be constantly working against this happening. First, you’ll be routinely tempted to invest your resources elsewhere—in things that will provide you with a more immediate payoff.
- And second, your family and friends rarely shout the loudest to demand your attention. They love you and they want to support your career, too.
- That can add up to neglecting the people you care about most in the world. The theory of good money, bad money explains that the clock of building a fulfilling relationship is ticking from the start.
- If you don’t nurture and develop those relationships, they won’t be there to support you if you find yourself traversing some of the more challenging stretches of life, or as one of the most important sources of happiness in your life.
- It’s easy for any of us to make assumptions about what our spouse might want, rather than work hard to understand the job to be done in our spouse’s life.
- the path to happiness in a relationship is not just about finding someone who you think is going to make you happy. Rather, the reverse is equally true: the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.
- To understand how all three work together, let’s continue the example of a child developing an iPad app.
- If your child has a computer on which to program, and knowledge of how to program an iPad app, he has resources.
- The way in which he pulls these resources together to create something novel, something that he hasn’t been taught explicitly how to do, to learn as he goes along—these are his processes.
- And the desire he has to spend his precious free time creating the app, the problem he cares about enough to create the app to solve, the idea of creating something unique, or the fact that he cares that his friends will be impressed—those are the priorities leading him to do it.
- Resources are what he uses to do it, processes are how he does it, and priorities are why he does it.
- The theory of capabilities suggests they need to be challenged. They need to solve hard problems. They need to develop values.
- Culture in any organization is formed through repetition. That way of doing things becomes the group’s culture.
- Kids won’t have to stop and think about what Mom or Dad wants them to do—they’ll just go about it because their family culture has dictated, “This is the way our family behaves.”
- A man who is dedicated to helping improve the lives of other people.
