## Notes:

- For example, if your flight arrives earlier than expected, you will be happy. On the other hand, if the flight is late, your reality is less desirable than your expectation and the mind produces negative feelings of annoyance.
- HAPPINESS equals WHAT I GET minus WHAT OTHERS GET
- …, in a study titled “When Less Is More: Counterfactual Thinking and Satisfaction among Olympic Medalists,” Tom Gilovich and his colleagues found that Olympic bronze medalists are actually happier than silver medalists. The silver medalists regret coming so close but not winning, whereas the bronze medalists compare themselves with the entire field and are thrilled to have won a medal at all.
- HAPPINESS equals WHAT I GET TODAY minus WHAT I GOT IN THE PAST
- Aversion to Loss: Losses are felt more keenly than equivalent gains.
- This law is called the Law of Hedonic Asymmetry by the Dutch psychologist Nico Frijda, or Loss Aversion by Kahneman and Tversky. According to the Law of Aversion to Loss, a ten dollar gain yields +2 happydons, but a ten dollar loss robs us of 5 happydons.
- We adapt to both good and bad circumstances much faster than anticipated.
- Bring to your mind some good or activity, which we will call X. Is X a basic good? Ask yourself the following questions: If nobody knew I’m buying or experiencing X, would I still want X? Will I enjoy X in the future, say five years from now, as much as I do now?
- Work is far from being just a source of money; it has actually been proven to be good for our happiness.
- Sooner or later we must realize there is no station. No one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is in the trip. The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us. —From “The Station” by Robert Hastings
- Forgiveness is the way to let go of accumulated bads.
- HAPPINESS IN ACTION: Select one hobby or interest and focus on developing it over time. It could be anything from gardening and athletics to reading and spiritual practice. Keep a diary to track your progress, and take time as you go to appreciate how much you’ve progressed.
- Re-framing activities are all those purposeful activities that make us see reality in a different way, reset our expectations, or create new comparisons.
- The practice of detachment, treating things that we use as if they were on loan, is mentally very healthy. This mitigates adaptation, and avoids the anxiety of a possible or actual loss.
- The lesson, once again, is that improving your reality will not increase happiness if expectations increase as well.
- We have the choice to see each day as a new day full of hope and experiences. We also have the choice of treating each day as a "Groundhog Day" in which we basically re-live the same day over and over.
- The conquest of satiation begins with seeing the world as a giant playground offering new challenges to overcome and new adventures to experience daily.
