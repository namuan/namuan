# Mental Models

## Box and Arrows

- What are you worried about?
  - ✅ Things you can control 
  - ❗ Things you can't control
- Let go of outcomes and expectations

## Invert

- Alternate path to the end goal
  - Eg. Avoid low marks vs achieving high marks
  - Focus on removing weak points
- Money doesn't buy happiness
  - But **it removed anxiety surrounding security, housing, food, providing and hunger**
- What failure will look like?
  - Define failure or causes of un-happiness
  - Create methods to avoid those things at all costs

## Six Hats

### White Hat **Sherlock Holmes**

- Tell me more?
- What does this mean?
- Where did you get that info?

### Red Hat **Sigmund Freud**

- How do you feel about something?
- How you do feel about options? -> Happy/UnHappy

### Black Hat **Eeyore, Donkey from Winnie the Pooh)

- Untimate depressed pessimist
- What could go wrong?
- Murphys Law: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong
- Planning for failure and worst case scenario

### Yellow Hat **Cheerleader**

- Motivating, positive and optimistic
- Gives you the push to proceed and take action

### Green Hat **Pablo Picasso**

- Think outside the box
- What if the current leading option to the problem is not feasible
- Explore multiple paths to move forward and reach your end goal

### Blue Hat **Henry Ford**

- Assembly line to integrate information from all other hats

## Map vs Territory

- A Map (or our understanding of something) is a picture or reality and **not reality itself**
- Teaching is a vehicle to describe the truth, 
  **it is not the truth itself**
- The description of the thing, 
  or the symbols we use for it 
  or any other abstraction to try to understand it, 
  **is not the thing itself**
