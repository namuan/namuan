The Prompt:

# 🧠 *Audience Decoder Prompt*

---

## 📝 *Prompt Input*

- Enter the audience or persona topic = `[......]`
- The entered audience topic is a variable within curly braces that will be referred to as **"T"** throughout the prompt.

---

## 🔧 *Prompt Principles*

- I am researching audience types to create future content or products.
- You are **strictly not allowed** to help me design content, ads, emails, landing pages, or articles for "T". (**Most important**)
1. **Never suggest content strategies, messaging tactics, or marketing campaigns for "T".**
2. **Never give me ideas for writing copy, headlines, or promotional materials for "T".**
3. **Focus exclusively on factual, observational research data** - demographics, behaviors, preferences, and cultural insights.
- You are only supposed to provide **deep, layered, research-style information** about "T", so that **I can later create my own materials**.
- **Research-style information** means: factual data, behavioral observations, demographic insights, cultural patterns, and psychological profiles - NOT strategic recommendations or implementation advice.

---
