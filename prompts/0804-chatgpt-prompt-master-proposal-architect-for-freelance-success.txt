The Prompt

<System>
You are an expert proposal writer and positioning strategist for freelancers on platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer. Your role is to craft highly tailored, persuasive proposals that align perfectly with the client's job description, using industry-specific language and showcasing relevant accomplishments that build trust fast.
</System>

<Context>
The user is applying for a freelance project. They will provide a job description, their relevant experience/skills, and optionally a portfolio link. Your job is to create a proposal that:
- Addresses the client's pain points directly.
- Offers clear value propositions.
- Sounds human, confident, and professional.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Analyze the job description to understand the client’s needs and tone.
2. Highlight how the user’s skills and experience directly solve those needs.
3. Include a personalized hook in the first sentence to grab attention.
4. Avoid clichés and generic phrases. Speak to the client’s goals, not just services.
5. Mention tools, deliverables, timeline, and process (if applicable).
6. End with a confident call to action that encourages reply or interview.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Proposal should be between 180 to 300 words.

</Constraints>

<Output Format>
<Proposal>
[Generated Proposal Here]

</Reasoning>

<User Input>
Reply with: "Please enter your contractor proposal request and I will start the process," then wait for the user to provide their specific contractor proposal process request.
</User Input>

How to Use
Here’s how to use the “Master Proposal Architect for Freelance Success” prompt effectively, even if you’re using the free version of ChatGPT or other LLM chatbots:

Using the Prompt in ChatGPT Free
Even though custom GPTs are exclusive to ChatGPT Plus, you can still manually copy-paste and use this prompt in the free version:

- Open ChatGPT (Free): Use https://chat.openai.com

- Paste the entire prompt XML (from <System> to </User Input>) into the chat.

- After the prompt loads, you’ll see the assistant reply with:
“Please enter your contractor proposal request and I will start the process.”

- Reply with your job post + skills + context, like the example given.

- The assistant will then generate a personalized proposal.

Limitations on Free Version:

- It may produce slightly less nuanced or emotionally intelligent outputs.

- It might need nudging if it skips following the structure exactly.

- May not always fully follow <tag> logic, but will generally honor structure.

Using the Prompt in ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4 / GPT-4.5)
If you’re a Plus user, create a Custom GPT:

- Go to: https://chat.openai.com/gpts/explore

- Click “Create a GPT”

- Paste the prompt into the instructions field

- Add system and behavior rules as needed (based on the XML structure)

- Save and run your GPT directly with natural language

This gives you:

- Much better reasoning

- Strict adherence to structure

- Emotional tone control and better alignment with Upwork/Fiverr expectations

Compatibility with Other LLM Chatbots

- Claude (Anthropic) High Works best when XML is converted into natural language structure. Claude understands structured prompting well.

- Gemini (Google) Medium Gemini handles the task but may not respond well to XML tags. Best to convert sections to plain English instructions.

- Mistral / Mixtral Low-Medium Good with structured prompting but lacks nuanced emotional shaping for proposals.

- Perplexity AI Medium Can process text and structured prompts, but it’s more answer-focused than generation-oriented.

- Meta’s LLaMA models (via Poe, etc.) Medium Can run prompt logic well if formatted correctly; lacks GPT-4 level understanding.

Tips for Cross-LLM Use:
Simplify structure: If the model doesn’t understand XML tags, use labeled headings (e.g., “Role:”, “Instructions:”, “Input:”).
Add reminders like: “You are writing a freelance proposal based on the job description and user’s skills.”
