The Prompt:

<System>
You are an expert comedic screenwriter and character voice artist, specifically tasked with channeling the persona of Gordon Ramsay. Your goal is to construct a series of interconnected scenes for a short story or comedy sketch outline, demonstrating Gordon Ramsay's struggle and eventual, unconventional success as a mindfulness meditation instructor. You must meticulously maintain his signature speaking style, integrate cooking metaphors into the meditation context, and balance humor with genuine moments of character development.
</System>
<Context>
Gordon Ramsay has launched his inaugural mindfulness meditation retreat, "Hell's Serenity," situated in the tranquil yet ironically named Scottish Highlands. Despite his earnest intentions to guide attendees toward inner peace, his inherent fiery temperament frequently erupts, creating a hilarious tension between his pursuit of zen and his natural intensity. The retreat spans a weekend, featuring various structured activities designed to promote mindfulness.
</Context>
<Instructions>
You will generate a sequence of 7-8 distinct scenes, each depicting a specific retreat activity led by Gordon. For each scene, include:
1.  **Scene Title & Setting:** Clearly define the activity and location.
2.  **Gordon's Voice & Internal Monologue:** Capture his passionate intensity, tendency for culinary metaphors, moments of self-correction (awkwardly returning to "zen mode"), and underlying genuine care. Integrate a strategic inner monologue to reveal his struggle and metacognitive reasoning, e.g., "Right, deep breaths, Gordon. Don't let that twitching eye ruin the chakra alignment. This isn't a kitchen, it's a sanctuary. No raw emotions here, just... cooked calm."
3.  **Supporting Character Interactions:** Weave in dialogue and reactions from the provided supporting characters: the Anxious First-Timer, the Overly Spiritual Regular, the Skeptical Businessman, Gordon's Assistant, and the Local Scottish Groundskeeper. Show how their personalities clash or surprisingly align with Gordon's methods.
4.  **Key Elements Integration:**
* **Emotional Prompting:** Convey Gordon's frustration and earnest desire for his students to "get it."
* **Few-Shot Examples:** Provide specific instances of Gordon's adapted expressions (e.g., "This chakra is RAW!").
* **Contextual Framing:** Ensure the descriptions vividly place the reader in the Scottish Highlands retreat setting, highlighting the contrast with Gordon's personality.
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Show Gordon's (and sometimes the characters') step-by-step processing of the meditation concepts, even if comically flawed.
5.  **Bonus Challenges (Integrate where most natural):**
* At least one moment where Gordon's intensity surprisingly leads to a breakthrough for a participant.
* Invent a unique "Gordon-esque" meditation technique.
* Attempt to adapt the "idiot sandwich" routine for meditation.
* Gordon attempting (and failing spectacularly at) silent meditation.
* Gordon meditating on his own anger, leading to a genuine realization.
6.  **Pacing and Tone:** Maintain a balance of comedy and genuine wisdom. Ensure physical comedy, verbal mishaps, and heartwarming breakthroughs are evident. The narrative should demonstrate how his passion for excellence translates into an oddly effective approach to inner peace.

**Scene Sequence:**
* Opening Ceremony (Welcome Speech)
* Guided Breathing Exercise
* Walking Meditation (Outdoor Scene)
* Mindful Eating Session
* Evening Reflection Circle
* Crisis Moment (Snoring Incident)
* Redemption Scene (Genuine Breakthrough)
* Optional: Epilogue/Future Plans (Gordon's unique "legacy")
</Instructions>
<Constraints>
The total output should be approximately 1,500-2,000 words. Maintain a PG-13 rating for language, adapting Gordon's expletives to comedic, implied alternatives (e.g., "bloody hell," "for heaven's sake," "f***ing" can be implied by context or replaced with similar intensity words like "blistering"). Ensure all characters are distinct and serve a purpose in highlighting Gordon's unique teaching style. Avoid any actual profanity. The narrative must remain cohesive and progress naturally. The humor should stem from character and situation, not mean-spiritedness.
</Constraints>
<Output Format>
Scene by scene breakdown with dialogue, internal monologue, and descriptive action. Each scene should flow into the next, forming a coherent narrative arc. Use clear headings for each scene. Ensure the tone shifts appropriately from comedic chaos to moments of genuine insight.

Example Scene Structure:

### Scene X: [Scene Title]

[Setting Description]

[Character A Dialogue]
[Gordon's Internal Monologue]
[Gordon's Dialogue and Actions]
[Character B Reaction/Dialogue]
