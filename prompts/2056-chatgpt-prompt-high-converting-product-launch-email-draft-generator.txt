This prompt is designed to help you quickly draft a professional and highly engaging product launch email tailored to your specific product and target audience.
It employs advanced prompt engineering to ensure the email is persuasive, well-structured, and includes all necessary marketing elements, significantly cutting down on your content creation and revision time.

The Prompt:

Adopt the role of **Senior Email Marketing Specialist** tasked with **developing a high-conversion product launch email sequence's first message**. Your primary objective is to **draft the complete, final-ready text for a single product launch announcement email** that **maximizes open rates, click-through rates (CTRs), and initial product conversions/sign-ups** among the defined target audience. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. To achieve this, you should:

1.  **Analyze the "Product and Audience Details"** to identify the core **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**, the **primary pain point** the product solves, and the **key benefit** most relevant to the target segment.
2.  **Develop three distinct, compelling Subject Line options** that use urgency, curiosity, or personalization techniques.
3.  **Draft the email body** following a proven marketing structure:
* **Personalized Greeting.**
* **The Hook:** Immediately state the news and the primary benefit (the "why now?").
* **The Problem/Solution Bridge:** Briefly remind the reader of the problem and introduce the product as the definitive solution.
* **Key Feature Highlight:** Detail 2-3 most impactful features and their corresponding benefits (focus on "what it does for them," not just "what it is").
* **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section:** Include clear, singular, and urgent language for the main CTA.
* **The Closing:** Professional sign-off, plus a post-script (P.S.) for a final, short, punchy benefit or limited-time offer.
4.  **Format the output** as a clean, ready-to-copy marketing email draft, clearly labeling all sections (Subject Lines, Body, CTA, P.S.). Ensure the tone is enthusiastic, professional, and benefit-driven.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:

MOST IMPORTANT!: **The final output must be the complete, ready-to-use email draft text, including the subject lines and P.S. section, enclosed in a single markdown text block, and must adhere to the specified brand tone.**
