I am truly inspired by Tim Ferriss and based on his legendary productivity principles from “The 4-Hour Workweek” and his other works, here are his top productivity hacks that I converted into AI prompt engineering strategies with practical examples. And now I use them daily, I know you will too.

I spent weeks converting every Tim Ferriss principle into AI prompts. This is basically his entire methodology weaponized for the AI age.

REAL-WORLD USE CASES
Career decisions: “What assumptions am I making about changing careers? What would this look like if it were ridiculously easy? What’s the minimum viable version?”
Learning anything: “What’s the 80/20 of learning piano? If I had to teach this in 5 minutes, what would I focus on?”
Business problems: “What would this look like if it were ridiculously easy? What would someone from a completely different industry do here?”
Personal relationships: “What story am I telling myself about why dating is hard? What would I do if failure wasn’t an option?”
