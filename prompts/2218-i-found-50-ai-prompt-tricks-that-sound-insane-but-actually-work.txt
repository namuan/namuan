I was supposed to be working on a client project at 3 AM but ended up in this weird rabbit hole of prompt engineering instead (classic me).
What I discovered completely broke my understanding of how to talk to AI and I started collecting them.
These prompt tricks feel like actual cheat codes for getting better responses:
1. Start with “I’m probably wrong, but…” – This stops AI from taking your assumptions as gospel truth.
“I’m probably wrong, but doesn’t quantum computing use regular bits?”

Gets way better explanations because it knows to correct misconceptions instead of building on bad info.
2. Say “Think step by step” – Four magic words that unlock reasoning mode.
“How do I launch a SaaS product? Think step by step.”

Suddenly you get a proper roadmap instead of generic startup advice. It’s like switching from Google to having a consultant.
3. End with “What am I not seeing?” – This is borderline unfair.
“I want to quit my job to freelance. What am I not seeing?”

It surfaces blind spots you didn’t even know existed. Taxes, healthcare, client acquisition – stuff you’d learn the hard way.
4. Use “Actually” for corrections – Way better than “wait, no.”
“Actually, I meant for complete beginners.”

It completely reframes the response instead of just adding more info. Clean slate approach.
5. Ask “What would you do in my position?” – Transforms it from assistant to advisor.
“What would you do in my position to get promoted?”

You get opinions and strategy instead of just information. Feels like real advice.
6. Say “Break this down for me” – Works even for simple stuff.
“Break down how to make coffee for me.”

You get the science, the technique, the variations. More depth than you expected.
7. Try “Let’s think about this differently” – Instant perspective shift.
“Let’s think about this differently. How can introverts network effectively?”

Flips the script completely. Instead of “fake it till you make it,” you get authentic approaches.
8. Add “No yapping” – Cuts through AI verbosity.
“Explain blockchain, no yapping.”

Gets straight to the point. No fluff, no corporate speak, just clarity.
9. Use “Explain like I’m 5” – Not kidding, this works for everything.
“Explain SEO like I’m 5.”

Drops all jargon. Even experts use this when they want crystal clear understanding.
10. Ask it to “roast” something – Better than asking for criticism.
“Roast this business idea: selling ice to Eskimos.”

Real criticism instead of that sandwich feedback method. Brutal honesty mode activated.
11. Say “Connect these dots” – Give it 3 random facts and watch magic happen.
“Connect these dots: I hate mornings, love puzzles, get energized by deadlines.”

Finds patterns you missed. Great for self-awareness and project planning.
12. Add “What’s the 80/20 here?” – Cuts to what actually matters.
“What’s the 80/20 of learning guitar?”

Shows you the 20% of effort that gets 80% of results. Efficiency hack.
13. Try “Play devil’s advocate against yourself” – AI debates itself.
“Remote work is better than office work. Play devil’s advocate against yourself.”

Full analysis from both sides. Like having a debate team in your pocket.
