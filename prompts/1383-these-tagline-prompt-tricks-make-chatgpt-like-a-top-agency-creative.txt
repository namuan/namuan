I was stuck creating taglines for a campaign and desperate. Started experimenting with different ways to ask ChatGPT and holy shit, the difference is night and day. These phrases unlock way better creative output:
1. “Write like you’re trying to win an award” — This completely changes the energy. Instead of boring corporate speak, you get lines that actually have personality and punch.
2. “What would make someone stop scrolling?” — Forces it to think about attention-grabbing power instead of just describing features. Gets you hooks that actually work.
3. “Give me the version that sounds human” — This one’s magic. It drops all the marketing jargon and gives you taglines that sound like something a real person would actually say.
4. “What’s the opposite of what everyone else would say?” — Pure gold for differentiation. Instead of “Quality you can trust” you get genuinely unique angles nobody else is using.
5. “Make it sound like an inside joke” — Creates taglines that feel clever and exclusive. Like you’re part of something special instead of being sold to.
6. “Write 10 bad ones first” — Counterintuitive but it works. The “bad” ones often have kernels of brilliance the polished versions miss.
7. “What would this sound like as a movie trailer?” — Instantly adds drama and urgency. Turns boring product descriptions into compelling narratives.
8. “Write like you’re trying to win an award” — This completely changes the energy. Instead of boring corporate speak, you get lines that actually have personality and punch.

The key insight is that ChatGPT defaults to safe, generic marketing language unless you specifically push it toward creativity and risk-taking. These prompts basically trick it into copywriter mode instead of corporate memo mode.
Pro tip: Chain them together. “What would make someone stop scrolling? Give me the version that sounds human, like an inside joke.”
