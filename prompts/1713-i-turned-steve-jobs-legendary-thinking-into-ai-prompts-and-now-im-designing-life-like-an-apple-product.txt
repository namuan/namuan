Imagine channeling the relentless curiosity, taste for simplicity, and audacity of the man who shaped the digital age, right into your daily decisions:
1. “If today were my last day, would I do what I’m about to do?”
Jobs famously started each day with this gut-check. Ask AI to audit your schedule: “Which tasks reflect my passion and priorities if today were my last?”
2. “What radically simple solution would blow people away?”
Jobs said simplicity is “the ultimate sophistication.” Challenge AI: “How can I reimagine this project to make it radically simpler and more delightful?”
3. “Where can I say no to 1,000 things?”
Obsessive focus means ruthless editing. “I’m working on [X]. What distractions should I remove to maintain laser focus?”
4. “What’s the intersection of technology and the liberal arts here?”
Jobs saw magic at this crossroad. “How can I combine tech and creativity to elevate my work or product?”
5. “How can I put a dent in the universe?”
Dream big, act bold. “Given my skills and context, what’s one ambitious move that could make a lasting impact?”
6. “Am I building for people, not just users?”
Jobs obsessed over user experience. “How does my current project genuinely improve someone’s life, not just fulfill a requirement?”
7. “What’s the story I’m telling—and is it worth telling?”
Everything at Apple told a story. “How can I craft a compelling narrative around this idea or initiative?”
8. “Am I shipping great work or settling for good enough?”
Jobs pushed teams for “insanely great.” “AI—review my project: What’s missing if I want it to be truly remarkable?”
9. “Where is the taste, not just the technology?”
Jobs valued artistry. “How do I add craftsmanship or elegance to this product, message, or solution?”
10. “Have I gone deep enough, or am I skimming the surface?”
He drilled past the obvious. “Where should I drill down to reach true insight or breakthrough?”
11. “What could this look like with a clean slate?”
Jobs started fresh, even with legacy products. “If we had nothing to lose and no constraints, what would this look like?”
12. “How do I obsess over end-to-end experience?”
Everything, from packaging to support, mattered. “What is the weakest link in my project’s experience, and how do I turn it into a wow moment?”
13. “What crazy idea am I afraid to pitch?”
Jobs encouraged risk. “AI, help me articulate the wildest version of my solution, holding nothing back.”
14. “How do I turn criticism into a new angle?”
Jobs used rejection as fuel. “What recent feedback can I invert into a unique competitive advantage?”
15. “Where can I do fewer things, better?”
Focus, always. “Am I spreading myself too thin? Which few priorities should get all my energy?”
16. “What would make this ten times better, not just 10%?”
Jobs thought in quantum leaps. “If my goal was 10x improvement, how would my approach change?”
17. “What wow moment can I create along the journey?”
Surprise and delight. “Is there a touchpoint in my work that could deliver unexpected delight?”
18. “Am I building for the future—or for the past?”
Jobs anticipated trends. “Am I solving yesterday’s problem, or the one people don’t know they’ll have tomorrow?”
19. “What limitations can spark my creativity?”
Jobs thrived on constraints. “How can I use my current limitations to inspire inventive solutions?”
20. “Who are my pirates—and do they have enough room to challenge the status quo?”
He wanted rebels with a cause. “How can I empower unconventional thinkers to challenge norms in my team or organization?”
21. “Will people love this?”
Not just need it—love it. “Is there an emotional hook or irresistible feature in what I’m creating?”
22. “How can I prototype this ASAP?”
Jobs worshipped iteration. “What’s the simplest version of my idea I can ship to get real feedback today?”
23. “What do I need to trust my intuition on?”
Jobs prized intuition as much as data. “Is there a decision where gut instinct should guide me more than analysis?”
24. “Where should I push back against the ‘experts?’”
He challenged conventional wisdom. “Where am I accepting common knowledge that deserves to be challenged?”
25. “What legacy am I building, one key decision at a time?”
It’s about the long arc. “How do today’s choices shape the bigger story of my life or work?”
Pick a couple of these Jobs-inspired AI prompts next time you’re stuck or designing your next big thing, see how your approach to work, life, or creativity gets bolder, more focused, and irresistibly original.
