7 Google Nano Banana prompts focusing on Group Photo Standardization with smile preservation, Dress Enhancement, Lighting Improvement, and a Cinematic Album Finish.

Prompt 1: The Essential Group Portrait Standard – Flawless Smiles & Clean Lighting
This is the foundational prompt, focused on ensuring all subjects are smiling perfectly, removing distractions, and applying classic soft event lighting.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of every person in the input image, while seamlessly incorporating an optimistic, joyful, wide smile onto every subject’s face. The group is framed from the waist up in a relaxed, clustered composition, with the wedding couple centered. The background is neutralized and de-cluttered, retaining only essential, high-end venue architectural elements with all distracting people, wires, and exit signs removed. Use large softbox key and fill lighting to eliminate harsh shadows and brighten the overall scene, creating a flattering, elegant, and celebratory atmosphere. Captured on a 70mm f/4 lens to maintain group focus (Group f-stop rule), with a slight depth of field and tack-sharp detail across all faces. Detail the texture of the wedding dress lace and suit fabrics with exquisite clarity. The color grading is clean, bright, and slightly warm (Daylight balanced), optimized for professional print quality.

Prompt 2: Cinematic Dress Feature Isolation – Low-Light Enhancement
This variant shifts the focus to dramatic low-light enhancement, specifically illuminating and detailing the wedding dress texture and accessories.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subjects in the input image. The primary subject (bride) is framed three-quarter length, with a serene and joyous expression, featuring a dramatic, full view of the gown. The background is transformed into a sophisticated, softly blurred evening reception environment, using selective focus to ensure the venue lights are rendered as beautiful, large ‘orbs’ of bokeh. Implement dramatic, directional ‘rim’ lighting from the back, highlighting the silhouette of the dress and veil, combined with a soft beauty dish key light on the faces, exuding intimate, luxurious atmosphere. Captured on a 105mm f/2 lens with extremely shallow depth of field, directing viewer focus entirely onto the dress and face. Emphasize the intricate beadwork, sheen of silk, and texture of the lace on the wedding gown with exceptional clarity and realism. The color grading is a rich, moody cinematic palette with deep blacks, subtle teal and orange toning, and glowing highlights.

Prompt 3: Outdoor Standardized Portrait – Golden Hour Magic
This prompt is designed for standardized standardization of individual guests or small groups, applying a consistent, flattering golden hour aesthetic for a cohesive album look.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subjects in the input image, ensuring a natural, relaxed smile for all. The subject(s) are framed from the chest up in a comfortable, natural pose. The background is converted to a soft-focus, richly colored natural outdoor environment (e.g., vineyard, garden) appropriate for a wedding, with all non-organic distractions removed. The lighting is transformed into low-angle, soft ‘Golden Hour’ sunlight from the side, creating long, flattering shadows and a warm glow around the hair and edges (rim light), conveying a romantic and classic aesthetic. Captured on an 85mm f/1.4 lens with a very shallow depth of field, ensuring beautiful, creamy bokeh and tack-sharp focus on the nearest eye. Achieve smooth, natural skin tone blending and crisp detail on clothing textures. Color grading is vibrant and deeply saturated in the warm tones, featuring rich gold and amber hues with lifted shadows for an airy finish.

Prompt 4: Venue Transformation Preview – Grand Architectural View
A prompt to envision the photo within a significantly upgraded, grander version of the actual venue, ideal for ‘before and after’ client previews.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subjects in the input image. The group is positioned in the foreground, using a low-angle, wide shot to emphasize scale. The background and environment are radically converted into a high-end, classic European ballroom or cathedral interior, featuring dramatic architectural elements, intricate ceiling details, and polished marble floors. Implement dramatic, multi-point ‘uplighting’ and recessed spot lighting throughout the environment, creating high contrast and theatrical shadows that draw the eye toward the ceiling, conveying majesty and opulence. Captured on a 24mm f/5.6 wide-angle lens to emphasize the grandeur of the space, ensuring maximum depth of field (hyperfocal distance) to keep both foreground subjects and background details sharp. Ensure the textures of the stone/marble and chandelier crystals are highly detailed. The color grading is cool and sophisticated with deep, rich blues and silver accents, utilizing high contrast and luminosity to define the architectural details.

Prompt 5: Standardized Full-Length Photo – Clean Studio Look
Designed for maximum standardization across a guest list, creating a ‘studio-quality’ image regardless of the original setting.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subject in the input image, ensuring a neutral, pleasant expression. The subject is framed full-length (head-to-toe), standing squarely. The background is replaced entirely with a smooth, perfectly seamless medium grey (‘#808080’) studio background. Lighting is implemented as a classic three-point studio setup: large main softbox, fill light for shadow reduction, and a subtle hair light, resulting in perfectly even and neutral illumination without distraction. Captured on a 135mm f/8 lens (optimized for full-length sharpness) with a precise focus on the center mass. All clothing textures are rendered with clinical, precise detail. The color grading is completely neutral and achromatic, designed for maximum color accuracy in post-production, perfect for catalog or guest list standardization.

Prompt 6: Extreme Weather Condition Improvement – Sunny Day Conversion
A technical conversion to simulate perfect, sunny weather conditions, regardless of the original image’s overcast or rainy state.
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subjects in the input image. The group is standing outdoors, framed mid-shot. The environment (sky, ground, foliage) is completely converted to look like a bright, warm summer day with a perfectly clear blue sky and lush, vibrant greenery. Lighting is transformed to high-angle, hard, directional sunlight, creating defined, slightly shortened shadows beneath the chin and a sparkling look on reflective surfaces (like jewelry), imparting energy and vibrancy. Captured on a 50mm f/5.6 lens for natural perspective and balanced depth of field. Ensure sparkling micro-detail on water or dew (if applicable) and crisp definition on grass and leaves. The color grading is vibrant, high-saturation, high-contrast with a strong shift towards the yellow and orange spectrum to emphasize the feeling of strong, warm sunshine.

Prompt 7: Album-Ready Finish – Film Emulation Aesthetic
The final finishing prompt, applying a sought-after aesthetic and texture for a cohesive, professional album look (e.g., film grain).
Edit this image. I need a high-resolution conversion, strictly maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person/subjects in the input image. The group is arranged in a full-frame, environmental portrait. All distracting elements in the background are subtly minimized through a gentle Gaussian blur. Implement mixed indoor/outdoor ambient light that is soft, slightly uneven, and deeply atmospheric. Captured on a 35mm f/2.8 lens for an immersive, slightly documentary feel. Crucially, the final image must be treated with visible, authentic medium-sized film grain texture (e.g., Kodak Portra 400 emulation) over all surfaces, including skin and background. The color grading features deliberate, slightly desaturated mid-tones, creamy pastel highlights, and a subtle color cast (e.g., magenta/green shift) with gently crushed shadows characteristic of analog film processing, delivering a timeless, romantic, and tactile finish.
