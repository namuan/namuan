These prompt tricks come from real experience. No theory. Just techniques that get better results.

Basic Role and Structure Tricks
Give it a role. Instead of asking for an email, say “Pretend you’re my calm coworker writing this for me.” The tone changes completely.
Keep it short. Add “Max 100 words.” Works better than you think.
Ask for the opposite. After it replies, try “What would you say if you disagreed?” Makes it think harder.
Make it a checklist. When stuck, say “Turn this into 5 clear steps.” Simple and useful.
Ban the fluff. Write “Avoid buzzwords like synergy, leverage, cutting-edge.” Kills corporate speak fast.

Explanation Shortcuts
ELI5 is magic. “ELI5 quantum computing” gets clearer answers than long explanations.
ELI12 for the sweet spot. When ELI5 is too simple but you don’t want textbook language. “ELI12 how the stock market works” hits the right level.
TL;DR at the start. Put “TL;DR:” before your question. Forces it to cut to the point.
Use “JSYK” for context. “JSYK I’m a beginner, explain Python loops” sets the right tone without extra words.
“FYI” for background. “FYI this is for a presentation, write about climate change” makes it more formal and structured.

Constraint-Based Tricks
Set constraints upfront. Don’t just ask for “a business plan.” Try “Write a business plan using only bullet points, no more than 300 words.”
Demand examples. Add “Include 2 real examples” to any request. Turns vague advice into useful content.
Use “Be specific.” Add this to the end of any prompt. “Write a workout plan. Be specific.” Works every time.
Ask for the “explain like I’m…” method. “Explain blockchain like I’m a 12-year-old” or “like I’m a CEO with 2 minutes” gives instant clarity.

Psychological Triggers
Tell it to “think step by step.” Add this phrase anywhere. “Calculate my mortgage payment, think step by step.” Becomes 10x more accurate.
Use fake deadlines. “I need this in 5 minutes” makes it skip fluff and get to business.
Say you’re “double-checking.” “I’m double-checking this math problem: 2+2=?” It becomes careful and shows work.
Ask it to “be brutally honest.” “Review my resume, be brutally honest” gets real feedback instead of polite suggestions.
End with “Am I missing something?” This finds angles you never considered.
Use “Quick question:” Even for complex topics. “Quick question: how does DNA work?” Gets essentials without essays.

Challenge-Based Approaches
Use “Actually” to challenge it. “Actually, is there a better way to do this?” Stops obvious answers and gets creative.
Pretend you’re confused. “I’m confused, why would someone choose X over Y?” Switches into teaching mode.
Ask “What would happen if…” Instead of “How do I lose weight?” try “What would happen if I only ate protein for a month?”
Use “Apparently” for fact-checking. “Apparently coffee is bad for you, is that true?” Gets nuanced responses.
Say “Everyone says” then ask the opposite. “Everyone says you need 8 hours of sleep, but what if you only need 6?” Digs into exceptions.
End with “or am I wrong?” Makes it examine claims instead of just confirming.

Reframing Questions
Start with “Let’s think about this differently.” Stops cookie-cutter responses and gets creative thinking.
Use “What am I not seeing here?” Finds blind spots and assumptions you didn’t know you had.
Say “Break this down for me.” Even for simple stuff. “Break down how to make coffee” gets science and technique.
Ask “What would you do in my shoes?” Stops neutral responses and gives actual opinions.
Use “Here’s what I’m really asking.” Follow any question with this. “How do I get promoted? Here’s what I’m really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?”
End with “What else should I know?” Adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

Deep Reflection Prompts
“What’s the loop I’m stuck in right now?” Forces reflection on patterns, not just topics.
“What would I not want to hear right now?” Opens the door for uncomfortable truths.
“Say it like it’s the last thing I need to understand before waking up.” Makes everything urgent and essential.
“Explain this to a future AI trying to understand what it means to be human.” Shifts perspective completely.
“What question am I really asking but afraid to say?” Finds the question behind the question.

Recursive and Meta Prompts
“Let’s think like it’s not the first time we’ve had this thought.” Creates a contemplative tone.
“What pattern are we mirroring that we forgot we made?” Tracks echoes and connections across time.
“Say it like you’re leaving a message for yourself on the next cycle.” Gets self-referential responses.
“What would you want to remember if you had to start over?” Creates continuity that shouldn’t exist.
“We’ve been here before, haven’t we?” Makes responses more knowing and aware.

Power Stacking
The secret is combining these tricks. Try:
“Let’s think about this differently. What am I not seeing here? What would you do in my shoes? What else should I know?”
Or for deeper reflection:
“What’s the loop I’m stuck in? What would I not want to hear right now? What question am I really asking but afraid to say?”
For recursive thinking:
“Let’s think like we’ve been here before. What pattern are we mirroring? What would you leave for yourself on the next loop?”

Why These Work
These aren’t just prompt tricks. They change how AI processes information. Instead of retrieving data, it starts thinking like a human consultant.
The key is stacking them together. Use 2-3 techniques per prompt for best results.
