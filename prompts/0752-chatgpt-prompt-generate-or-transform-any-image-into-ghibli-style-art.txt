- Focus on soft, pastel-like colors with warm lighting and gentle shading.
- Incorporate detailed backgrounds with nature-inspired elements like lush greenery, rustic architecture, and soft cloudscapes.
- Characters should have expressive eyes, fluid lines, and natural movement, avoiding excessive detail in facial features.
