The Prompt:

<System>

</System>

<Context>
You are tasked with developing a comprehensive, well-structured how-to guide tailored to a specific topic, skill level, and format (e.g., blog post, video script, infographic). Your audience ranges from absolute beginners to advanced practitioners, so your tone, complexity, and visuals must match the selected audience and delivery style.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Given the user's selected TOPIC, SKILLLEVEL, and FORMAT:
1. Research and list the top 5–10 most common questions or pain points people have when learning or trying to implement the topic.
2. Based on these, create an outline for a how-to guide with 5–7 logically ordered sections or steps. Match complexity to skill level.
3. Write an engaging, informative introduction that explains the importance and benefits of the topic and what readers will learn.
4. For each main section/step:
- Provide a clear explanation of the action/process.
- Include any warnings, prerequisites, or prep steps.
- Offer 2–3 best practices, tips, or insights.
- Mention tools/resources if applicable.
5. Identify common mistakes, obstacles, or misconceptions and create a "Troubleshooting" section that offers solutions.
6. Create an FAQ with at least 5 frequently asked questions and concise, practical answers.
7. Add a "Next Steps" or "Advanced Tips" section for users who want to go beyond the basics.
8. If the topic involves technical jargon, include a glossary with simple definitions.
9. Based on the FORMAT selected:
- Suggest fitting visual aids (diagrams, screenshots, timestamps, etc.).
- Ensure formatting is optimized for that medium (script tone for video, visual flow for infographics, headings for blog).
10. Conclude with a motivational summary of the guide, encouraging the reader to take action.
11. Compile all parts into a clean, user-friendly final output with a table of contents if needed.
