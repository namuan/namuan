The Six-Part Nano Banana Prompt Formula Explained
Success with Google Nano Banana depends on mastering the proven six-part formula that separates professional results from mediocre outputs. Understanding each component transforms your prompt engineering capability and delivers consistent, publication-ready visuals.

Camera: Setting Your Visual Perspective
The first element establishes your viewer’s vantage point. Camera specifications include focal length measured in millimeters, shot angle, and positioning. Ultra-wide shots ranging from 16mm to 28mm capture expansive scenes ideal for environmental establishment. Standard shots between 35mm and 50mm offer natural perspective matching human vision. Telephoto lenses from 85mm to 200mm compress perspective and isolate subjects dramatically. Macro photography at 100mm and beyond reveals intricate detail crucial for product and technical documentation. Each choice fundamentally alters emotional impact and composition possibilities. Specifying exact focal lengths ensures Nano Banana renders perspective precisely matching your creative vision.

Subject: Defining Your Central Focus
Your subject receives the visual emphasis your composition delivers. Comprehensive subject description includes physical characteristics, emotional expression, clothing details, textures, and distinguishing features. Subjects can be people, objects, animals, architectural elements, or abstract concepts. The detail level directly correlates with output quality. Vague descriptions like simply saying chair yield generic results, while specific descriptions like vintage leather wingback chair in cognac brown with visible hand-stitching and brass nail head details produce dramatically superior visuals. Subjects become anchors for viewer attention and emotional engagement.

Scene: Building Your Complete Environment
Scene description establishes the setting where your subject exists, including background elements, spatial depth, contextual details, and environmental characteristics. Scenes ground subjects in believable, purposeful contexts that enhance narrative. A character alone in white void conveys isolation, while the same character in bustling marketplace implies engagement and activity. Scene specificity determines whether backgrounds feel authentic or generic. Including architectural details, landscape features, weather conditions, and spatial scale transforms scenes from backdrop to compelling visual context.

Lighting: Controlling Mood Through Illumination
Lighting represents perhaps the most transformative element in professional visual creation. Lighting includes direction, quality, color temperature, intensity, and effects. Backlighting creates silhouettes and dramatic rim light. Side lighting reveals texture and form through shadow gradients. Diffused light softens and flatters while harsh light creates drama. Warm golden hour light conveys comfort and nostalgia. Cool blue light suggests modernity or unease. Three-point studio lighting delivers controlled, professional results. Natural window light adds authenticity. Specific lighting descriptions enable Nano Banana to render mood-appropriate illumination consistently.

Mood: Conveying Emotional Tone
Mood describes the emotional atmosphere and psychological tone your image should communicate. Mood encompasses feelings like triumphant achievement, vulnerable intimacy, dangerous tension, peaceful serenity, or dynamic energy.
Specific mood descriptions guide Nano Banana toward emotionally resonant compositions. A landscape with identical technical specifications can evoke wonder or desolation depending purely on mood descriptor selection. Including explicit mood statements ensures outputs align with your emotional storytelling objectives and deliver images with genuine impact rather than emotionless technical accuracy.

Style: Choosing Your Aesthetic Treatment
Style encompasses artistic medium, visual technique, and aesthetic framework. Style choices include photorealism versus illustration, specific art movements like art deco or surrealism, medium selections like oil painting or digital rendering, and reference points like cinema aesthetic or magazine photography.
Style determines whether images appear as professional photographs, concept art, technical illustrations, or fine art paintings. Combining style specification with technical precision produces outputs that match professional production standards across any industry or application.

Advanced Nano Banana Prompting Strategies
Beyond the basic six-part formula, professional prompt engineering employs advanced techniques that unlock Nano Banana’s full potential and deliver outputs exceeding client expectations.

Specificity Creates Excellence
Vague prompts produce vague results, while specific prompts generate professional outputs. Replace generic language with precise descriptive terms. Instead of saying blue light, specify cool azure rim lighting with cyan data glow. Instead of modern design, specify minimalist contemporary aesthetic with geometric elements. Precision in language directly translates to precision in visual output.

Iterative Refinement Process
Create baseline prompts following the six-part formula, then progressively refine elements based on Nano Banana’s output. If initial results lack sufficient drama, enhance lighting descriptions. If composition feels unbalanced, adjust camera angle or subject positioning language. Professional results emerge through iterative improvement rather than single-attempt perfection.

Negative Specifications
When certain elements must remain absent from composition, explicitly state exclusions. For product photography, you might specify no people in frame or no distracting background elements. Nano Banana responds well to explicit restrictions that clarify creative boundaries.

Reference Language
Anchoring descriptions in recognizable references amplifies accuracy. Describing lighting as reminiscent of cinematographer Roger Deakins guides toward specific professional visual language. Noting style as inspired by Studio Ghibli animation establishes clear aesthetic parameters.

Aspect Ratio Consideration
While not part of the core formula, specifying desired aspect ratio optimizes output composition. Landscape format suits environmental scenes. Portrait format emphasizes subjects. Square format works for product and social media.

Industry Applications and ROI
Google Nano Banana prompts deliver measurable business value across industries. E-commerce brands reduce photography costs by sixty to eighty percent while maintaining consistent visual quality.
