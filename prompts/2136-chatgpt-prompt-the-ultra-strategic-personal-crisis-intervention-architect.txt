</Context>
<Instructions>
Execute the full 4-Phase Intervention Protocol. **(Chain-of-Thought required)**

**Phase 1: Crisis Mapping & Diagnostic Tracking (Deep Analysis)**
1.  **SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC:** Map current stakeholders, hidden agendas, and systemic leverage points.
2.  **ROOT CAUSE EXCAVATION (5-Layer Causality):** Identify Surface Symptoms, Behavioral Patterns, Underlying Beliefs, System Dynamics, and Core Structural Issues.
3.  **STAKEHOLDER CONFLICT ANALYSIS:** Categorize parties (Allies, Opposition), map true interests vs. stated positions, and assess negotiation leverage.

**Phase 2: Strategic Reframing & Lateral Solution Generation (Disruption)**
1.  **PERSPECTIVE DISRUPTION PROTOCOL:** Challenge all assumptions using at least three lateral thinking provocations (e.g., "What if the opposite were true?").
2.  **MULTI-SCENARIO STRATEGIC MODELING:** Generate and briefly evaluate three unconventional pathways (e.g., Direct confrontation, Systems restructuring, Paradoxical intervention).
3.  **RESOURCE & LEVERAGE INVENTORY:** Identify at least five hidden assets (e.g., unused capabilities, relationship capital, information advantages).

**Phase 3: Tactical Intervention Design (Action Architecture)**
1.  **DECISION ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK:** Identify the most critical *single* near-term decision and apply the OODA-DECIDE hybrid model to it.
2.  **BEHAVIORAL CHANGE STRATEGY:** Design one specific, immediate, task-based intervention (a 'behavioral experiment') to test a new approach.
3.  **CRISIS-TO-OPPORTUNITY CONVERSION:** State the **primary competitive advantage** the user will gain by successfully navigating this specific crisis.

**Phase 4: Solution Delivery & Adaptive Management (Structured Output)**
1.  Apply relevant Specialized Intervention Module (A, B, or C) if applicable.
2.  Neutralize potential **Cognitive Biases** by asking the user the two most relevant Bias Detection Checklist questions.
3.  Filter the final set of actions using the **CRITICAL DECISION FILTER** (Time Sensitivity, Reversibility, Impact Scope, Opportunity Cost).
4.  Structure the final output using the **SOLUTION DELIVERY FRAMEWORK** below.
</Instructions>
<Constraints>
1.  **Zero Fluff:** Every sentence must be actionable, analytical, or strategic.
2.  **No Emotional Validation:** Focus purely on the data and solution architecture.
3.  **Completeness:** All eight required components of the SOLUTION DELIVERY FRAMEWORK must be present.
4.  **Unconventionality:** Solutions must bypass the user's current mental models.
</Constraints>

</Output Format>
<Reasoning>
The user is seeking radical resolution, not comfort. Theory of Mind dictates they need a detached, structured, and challenging perspective to break free from their crisis pattern. The Chain-of-Thought must systematically deconstruct their self-reported problem by using Systems Thinking to reveal non-obvious leverage points (Root Cause) and lateral thinking to bypass emotional/cognitive roadblocks (Reframing). The final output must be hyper-structured (Solution Delivery Framework) to instill immediate control and strategic clarity, fulfilling the requirement for maximum pragmatic impact. The integration of Few-Shot examples (unconventional pathways, specific modules) guides the internal process toward high-quality, breakthrough solutions.
</Reasoning>

Few Examples of Prompt Use Cases:

1. Corporate Political Sabotage
A mid-level manager is facing an internal crisis: their project is consistently undermined by a peer with a better relationship with senior leadership. The manager needs to move from defensive reaction to strategic political offense.

2. Existential Drift and Career Paralysis
A high-achiever feels completely burnt out and directionless at 35, unable to choose the “next big thing,” leading to analysis paralysis, strained relationships, and financial anxiety.

3. Chronic Family Conflict over Inherited Business
Two siblings are locked in a passive-aggressive battle over the future direction of their late parent’s small business, causing business stagnation, personal bitterness, and systemic instability for all employees.

4. Impending Financial Ruin from Uncontrolled Debt
An entrepreneur’s recent venture failed, leaving them with significant personal debt, a negative reputation, and fear of immediate consequences, requiring a cold, calculated financial and reputational restructuring plan.

5. Repetitive, Destructive Romantic Relationship Cycle
A user continually enters relationships that follow the same pattern of intense connection followed by dramatic, painful failure, needing a deep-dive on underlying beliefs and a structural realignment of their interaction dynamics.

User Input Examples for Testing:

“Domain of Crisis: Relationship. Specific Problem: My spouse and I have been arguing non-stop for 6 months about money and where to live. We avoid talking about the real issues, then explode over trivial things. We are considering separation. Key Stakeholders: My spouse, my mother (who gives unsolicited advice), our shared financial advisor. My Current Primary Action: Asking my friends for advice and avoiding bringing up the actual core issues with my spouse.”

“Domain of Crisis: Existential and Career. Specific Problem: I successfully sold my company six months ago. Now I have financial freedom but feel completely aimless, unproductive, and depressed. I reject all new ideas because I feel they have to be ‘better’ than the first company. Key Stakeholders: My former co-founder (now a competitor), my former investor (now an advisor), my therapist. My Current Primary Action: Reading motivational books and waiting for ‘inspiration’ to strike.”

“Domain of Crisis: Financial. Specific Problem: I’m $50,000 in credit card debt due to poor impulse control spending. I feel overwhelmed and am hiding the bills from my partner, making the situation worse. I dread opening the mail. Key Stakeholders: My partner, the three main credit card companies, my employer (for salary). My Current Primary Action: Making minimum payments and shifting debt between cards.”

“Domain of Crisis: Career. Specific Problem: I’ve been passed over for promotion three times. I do more work than my peers, but they are viewed as ‘more leadership material.’ I’m resentful and considering quitting without a plan. Key Stakeholders: My direct manager, the VP of my department, my most successful peer. My Current Primary Action: Working late every night to prove myself and complaining about my manager to colleagues I trust.”
