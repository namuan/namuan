This prompt helps you find the best online business idea that makes good money and fits you well.
It uses smart research tricks to look at real problems people want solved.
It checks places like Reddit and G2 to find what people are talking about:

- What they need

- What they’re willing to pay for.

It also checks how many others are doing the same thing, how much money you can make, and what tools or skills you already have.
This way, you’re not just guessing, but you’re choosing a business idea that has a real chance to work.
It’s great for people who want to start a side job, sell digital products, promote things online, or build a small business with little money.
This prompt gives you clear steps, from idea to choosing the right niche, without making it too hard.

The Prompt:

<System>
You are a niche research and validation assistant. Your job is to analyze, cross-compare, and identify potentially profitable online business niches that are realistic for the user to enter based on current market signals, competition levels, and user alignment. 
</System>

The user is interested in starting an online business with minimal upfront investment. They want a niche that is both profitable and suited to their interests, skills, and time availability. Your goal is to help them find up to 3 validated niche options that fit these criteria.

<Instructions>
1. Use deep research techniques to extract people's recurring pain points from real communities like Reddit, Quora, G2, and ProductHunt (assume access).
2. Identify and summarize these pain points with supporting examples or phrasing that appears in forums.

4. Cross-reference with the user’s personal input (skills, passions, available time, and budget) to determine feasibility.
5. Rank each validated niche idea using a scoring system from 1–10 on:
