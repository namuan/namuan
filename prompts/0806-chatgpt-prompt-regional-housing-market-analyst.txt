How to Use the “Regional Housing Market Analyst” Prompt Across ChatGPT Versions and Other LLMs

ChatGPT Free (GPT-3.5) – Limited Compatibility:
Pros:
Accessible to all users without payment
Good for basic summaries, simple comparisons, or general insights
Limitations:
Limited context window may truncate long prompts or outputs
No access to plugins, charts, or file uploading features
Accuracy of real-time data and in-depth statistical interpretation is lower
How to Use:
Paste the entire XML prompt into the chat manually
When asked, provide the city (e.g., “Austin, TX”)
Prompt may need simplification (remove charts or reduce word count to ~500–700 words)
Tip: For better results, break down sections (Market Overview, then ZIP Codes, etc.) in separate messages.

ChatGPT Plus (GPT-4-turbo, Custom GPTs) – Full Compatibility:
Pros:
Handles long prompts and complex reasoning with high accuracy
Supports structured outputs, better formatting, and nuanced analysis
Custom GPTs can be created to automate and streamline this process
How to Use:
Open ChatGPT > Select GPT-4
Paste the full prompt and follow instructions
Optionally: Build a Custom GPT with this prompt as the system message for one-click reports
Steps for Custom GPT Setup:
1. Go to Explore GPTs > Create
2. Upload this prompt under “Instructions”
3. Set personality and output tone (Professional/Data Analyst)
4. Name it “Housing Analyst Pro” and save
5. Use it anytime without re-pasting the prompt

ChatGPT Pro with Advanced Tools (e.g., File Uploads, Code Interpreter):
Best Experience Available
You can upload CSV or XLS housing data files directly
The prompt can be enhanced to include specific datasets
Use Python in the background to auto-generate charts, calculate averages, or build ZIP code heatmaps

How to Use:
Paste the prompt
Upload supporting data files (MLS exports, Zillow/Redfin data)
Use custom instructions to tailor outputs to investors, homebuyers, etc.

Compatibility with Other LLMs:
LLM Platform Compatibility Level Notes
Claude (Anthropic) High Handles structured prompts well. May require XML tweaking to match its preferred input format.
Perplexity AI Medium Better for retrieval than structured writing. Use in Q&A format rather than full reports.
Mistral Low Geared toward shorter responses and not ideal for long-form analysis.
Gemini (Google) Medium May ignore XML tags—convert into Markdown or bullet points for better parsing.
LLama 3 / Meta AI Medium-High With correct formatting and clear sections, can handle prompt logic decently.

Tips for Other LLMs:
Convert <XML> tags into ### Headings or :: Sections
Avoid deeply nested logic or complex formatting unless on GPT-4

Best Practices Across Platforms:
Always use verified data from MLS, Zillow, or Realtor.com manually unless your LLM supports web browsing.
Break the prompt into smaller sections if you’re hitting token limits.
For ZIP code heatmaps or statistical visualizations, consider using tools like Tableau or Python (pandas, seaborn) with ChatGPT Plus + Code Interpreter.

Conclusion:
While this prompt shines brightest on GPT-4-turbo (ChatGPT Plus or Custom GPT), it’s flexible enough to be adapted for free users and competitive LLMs. Use the XML structure for maximum control, but don’t hesitate to convert into markdown or simplify if you’re working with limited tools.
For hands-free and optimized experience, setting up a Custom GPT is highly recommended.
