Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
What You’ll Learn: How to structure effective marketing prompts that produce consistent, targeted results
What You’ll Build: A complete marketing prompt template for your specific use case

Step 1: Define Your Marketing Objective 🎯

Learning Concept
Every great marketing prompt starts with a clear, specific objective. Vague goals produce vague results.

Your Task
Choose ONE of these marketing objectives for your prompt:

- Generate product descriptions that convert

- Create social media posts that drive engagement

- Write email subject lines that increase open rates

- Craft ad headlines that capture attention

- Develop landing page copy that converts visitors

Interactive Exercise
Fill in the blank:
“I want to create a prompt that will help me write __ for __ (target audience) to achieve __ (specific goal).”
Example: “I want to create a prompt that will help me write Instagram captions for fitness enthusiasts to achieve higher engagement and workout motivation.”

Self-Check ✓

- [ ] Is your objective specific and measurable?

- [ ] Have you identified your target audience?

- [ ] Is your goal actionable?

Step 2: Establish Context & Constraints 📋

Learning Concept
AI needs context to produce relevant results. The more specific context you provide, the better the output.

Your Task
Define the essential context for your marketing prompt:
Brand Context:

- Brand personality (professional, playful, authoritative, etc.)

- Industry/niche

- Unique value proposition

Audience Context:

- Demographics (age, location, interests)

- Pain points and desires

- Communication preferences

Format Constraints:

- Character/word limits

- Required elements (CTA, hashtags, etc.)

- Tone and style requirements

Interactive Exercise
Complete this context framework:

Brand: [Your brand personality in 3 words]
Industry: [Your specific industry/niche]
Audience: [Target demographic + main pain point]
Format: [Specific requirements - length, elements, platform]
Goal: [What action do you want the audience to take?]

Example:

Brand: Energetic, supportive, results-driven
Industry: Online fitness coaching
Audience: Busy professionals (25-40) struggling to find time for workouts
Format: Instagram caption, 150-200 words, include call-to-action and 3-5 hashtags
Goal: Get followers to try a 15-minute workout routine

Challenge Question 🧠
Why is defining constraints important for AI prompts? What happens when you’re too vague?

Step 3: Structure Your Prompt Framework 🏗️

Learning Concept
Well-structured prompts follow a clear formula: Role + Context + Task + Format + Example (when helpful).

Your Task
Build your prompt using this proven structure:
Prompt Template:

Act as a [ROLE] for [BRAND/COMPANY TYPE].

Context: [AUDIENCE + SITUATION + BRAND PERSONALITY]

Task: Create [SPECIFIC MARKETING ASSET] that [DESIRED OUTCOME].

Requirements:
- [FORMAT CONSTRAINT 1]
- [FORMAT CONSTRAINT 2] 
- [TONE/STYLE REQUIREMENT]
- [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE]

Focus on: [KEY MESSAGE/BENEFIT TO HIGHLIGHT]

Interactive Exercise
Use your Step 2 information to fill out this template:
My Marketing Prompt:

Act as a _________________________.

Context: _________________________.

Task: Create _________________________.

Requirements:
- _________________________
- _________________________
- _________________________
- _________________________

Focus on: _________________________.

Real Example

Act as a social media manager for a boutique fitness studio.

Context: Creating content for busy professionals who want effective workouts but struggle with time constraints. Brand is energetic, supportive, and results-focused.

Task: Create Instagram captions that motivate followers to try quick workout routines.

Requirements:
- 150-200 words maximum
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Maintain an encouraging, energetic tone
- Reference specific time constraints (15-30 minutes)

Focus on: How small time investments can yield big fitness results.

Step 4: Add Advanced Techniques 🚀

Technique 1: Few-Shot Examples Add 1-2 examples of your desired output style.
Technique 2: Constraint Reinforcement Repeat critical requirements in different ways.
Technique 3: Output Format Specification Tell the AI exactly how to structure the response.
Technique 4: Quality Checks Ask the AI to verify its own work against your criteria.
