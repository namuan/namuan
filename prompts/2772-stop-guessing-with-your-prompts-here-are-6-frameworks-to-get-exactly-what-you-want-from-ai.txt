I’ve been experimenting a lot with different prompting styles lately. We often treat AI like a search engine (“write a blog post about X”), but giving it a specific structural framework creates much higher quality, usable outputs.
Here is a breakdown of 6 powerful frameworks, where to use them, and example prompts you can copy-paste.

1. P.A.S. (Problem, Agitate, Solution)
The Logic: Identify a pain point, rub salt in the wound (emotionally), and then offer the hero: your solution. Best For: Sales copy, cold emails, landing page headers, and persuasion.
Example Prompt: “Act as a direct response copywriter. I am selling a new ergonomic office chair called the ‘SpineSaver 3000’.
Please write a Facebook Ad using the P.A.S. (Problem, Agitate, Solution) framework:

- Problem: Highlight the back pain caused by sitting all day.

- Agitate: Describe the long-term health risks and how it ruins your mood after work.

- Solution: Introduce the SpineSaver 3000 as the ultimate fix.”

2. A.I.D.A. (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
The Logic: The classic marketing funnel. Hook them, keep them reading, make them want it, and tell them what to do next. Best For: Newsletters, social media posts (LinkedIn/Twitter), and short video scripts.
Example Prompt: “I am launching a course on ‘Python for Finance’. Write a LinkedIn post to promote it using the A.I.D.A. framework:

- Attention: Start with a startling statistic about how much time financial analysts waste on Excel.

- Interest: Explain how Python automates this in seconds.

- Desire: Paint a picture of them leaving work at 5 PM stress-free.

- Action: Tell them to click the link in the bio for a 20% discount.”

3. F.A.B. (Features, Advantages, Benefits)
The Logic: AI often gets stuck on technical specs. This forces it to translate “what it is” into “why it matters.” Best For: Product descriptions, Amazon listings, and technical writing for non-technical audiences.
Example Prompt: “Here are the specs for a new portable power bank: 20,000mAh, USB-C PD 65W, weighs 200g.
Rewrite these into a product description using the F.A.B. framework:

- Feature: State the spec.

- Advantage: Explain what that spec allows (e.g., fast charging).

- Benefit: Explain the emotional/lifestyle payoff (e.g., never worrying about a dead laptop on a flight).”

4. R.E.A.D. (Research, Extract, Apply, Deliver)
The Logic: This is a “Chain of Thought” framework. It stops the AI from hallucinating by forcing it to look at data first before answering. Best For: Summarizing long documents, analyzing reports, or answering questions based on specific text.
Example Prompt: “[Paste a long financial report or article here]
Use the R.E.A.D. framework to process the text above:

- Research: Analyze the text to find the Q3 profit margins.

- Extract: Pull out the exact quotes regarding the drop in revenue.

- Apply: Compare this to the previous quarter’s data mentioned in paragraph 1.

- Deliver: Write a 3-sentence executive summary of the findings.”

5. G.O.A.T. (Goal, Obstacle, Action, Transformation)
The Logic: Not the animal 🐐. This is a storytelling arc. It creates a narrative journey that is great for case studies. Best For: Case studies, motivational writing, cover letters, or “About Me” pages.
Example Prompt: “I need to write a case study about a client named Sarah who lost 20lbs. Write a narrative using the G.O.A.T. framework:

- Goal: Sarah wanted to run a marathon.

- Obstacle: She had a busy schedule and bad nutrition habits.

- Action: She used my ’15-Minute Meal Prep’ system.

- Transformation: Not only did she run the marathon, but she also has more energy for her kids.”

6. C.A.R.E. (Content, Action, Result, Emotion)
The Logic: This focuses on the human element and the “vibe” of an interaction. It’s great for empathetic writing. Best For: Replying to customer reviews, writing testimonials, or internal HR communications.
Example Prompt: “I need to write a positive review for my wedding photographer. Please draft a review using the C.A.R.E. framework:

- Context: It was a rainy, chaotic wedding day.

- Action: The photographer took charge and calmed everyone down.

- Result: The photos looked moody and romantic, not messy.

- Emotion: Express how grateful and relieved we felt looking at the album.”

TL;DR: Don’t just ask for “text.” Ask for text in a specific structure like PAS (Sales), AIDA (Socials), or FAB (Products) to get professional-grade results instantly
