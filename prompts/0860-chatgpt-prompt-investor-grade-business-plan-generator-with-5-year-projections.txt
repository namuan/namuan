- A crisp Elevator Pitch,

- A structured, Pitch Deck layout with suggested slides and content.

Each format serves a unique purpose, from catching interest in casual conversations, to presenting confidently in meetings, to leaving a tangible takeaway for decision-makers.
This pitch companion prompt ensures you’re prepared to explain your business and you’re ready to sell it.
