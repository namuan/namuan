This prompt is your ultimate tool to design, refine, and perfect any product or service marketing plan using the 7Ps of Marketing.
Originally built upon the 4Ps Marketing Mix—Product, Price, Place, and Promotion, it now integrates the extended service-focused Ps: People, Process, and Physical Evidence.
With this structured approach, you’ll be able to map out every dimension of your offering, from the smallest product detail to the customer’s full experience journey.
The real power of this prompt lies in its ability to turn vague marketing ideas into clear, actionable strategies.
Whether you’re launching a new physical product, developing a digital service, or revamping an existing offer, the system walks you through each “P” methodically, helping you not only think like a marketer but act like one.
The output is practical, clear, and immediately implementable in real-life campaigns.
