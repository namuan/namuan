I’ve been diving deep into Maslow’s psychology lately and realized his self-actualization principles work incredibly well as AI prompts.
It’s like turning AI into your personal human potential coach:
1. “What unmet basic need is blocking my growth here?”
Pure Maslow hierarchy. AI cuts through surface issues to find the root deficit. “I can’t focus on my creative projects. What unmet basic need is blocking my growth here?” Suddenly you realize you’re financially stressed.
2. “How would I approach this if I were already self-actualized?”
Identity shift from Maslow’s peak performers. Changes your entire strategy instantly. “How would I handle this conflict if I were already self-actualized?” AI channels that centered, growth-focused mindset.
3. “What would fulfilling my full potential look like in this situation?”
Self-actualization as a compass. Perfect for when you’re playing small. “I’m considering three job offers. What would fulfilling my full potential look like in this situation?”
4. “Where am I trying to meet deficiency needs vs growth needs?”
Maslow’s D-needs vs B-needs distinction. AI spots when you’re operating from lack vs abundance. “I keep seeking approval from others. Where am I trying to meet deficiency needs vs growth needs?”
5. “What would this look like through B-cognition instead of D-cognition?”
Being-cognition vs Deficit-cognition. Shifts from evaluative to accepting awareness. “I’m stressed about this presentation. What would this look like through B-cognition instead of D-cognition?”
6. “How can I move from surviving to thriving here?”
Hierarchy movement prompt. Perfect for breaking survival mode patterns. “I’m constantly firefighting at work. How can I move from surviving to thriving here?”
7. “What peak experience qualities am I not accessing?”
Maslow’s 16 peak experience aspects as prompts. AI identifies missing elements of optimal functioning. “I feel stuck in routine. What peak experience qualities am I not accessing?”
8. “If I fully accepted myself and this situation, what would change?”
Self-acceptance as transformation catalyst. Pure Maslow wisdom. “I hate my body and it affects everything. If I fully accepted myself and this situation, what would change?”
9. “What would loving detachment look like here?”
Maslow’s autonomous detachment concept. Great for overinvestment issues. “I’m too emotionally invested in this outcome. What would loving detachment look like here?”
10. “Where am I seeking external validation instead of internal growth?”
Esteem needs vs self-actualization distinction. AI reveals dependency patterns. “I need constant praise to feel good about my work. Where am I seeking external validation instead of internal growth?”
11. “What’s my authentic response versus my conditioned response?”
Spontaneity vs social programming. Classic Maslow self-actualization trait. “Everyone expects me to be the funny one. What’s my authentic response versus my conditioned response?”
12. “How can I approach this with fresh eyes, like seeing it for the first time?”
Maslow’s “continued freshness of appreciation.” Breaks stagnant thinking. “I’m bored with my relationship. How can I approach this with fresh eyes, like seeing it for the first time?”
13. “What would creative play bring to this challenge?”
Self-actualized creativity and playfulness. Pure Maslow insight. “I’m stuck on this problem. What would creative play bring to this challenge?”
14. “Where am I resisting my own growth?”
Growth motivation vs security motivation tension. AI spots self-sabotage patterns. “I keep avoiding opportunities. Where am I resisting my own growth?”
15. “How can I honor both my individuality and my connection to others?”
Balance between autonomy and belonging needs. Maslow’s integration wisdom. “I feel lonely but also want independence. How can I honor both my individuality and my connection to others?”
16. “What would ‘being’ instead of ‘doing’ reveal here?”
B-values emphasis on being over having/doing. Shifts from action addiction. “I’m constantly busy but unfulfilled. What would ‘being’ instead of ‘doing’ reveal here?”
17. “Where am I creating artificial scarcity in abundance?”
Deficiency mindset in non-deficient situations. AI spots fear-based thinking. “I worry about money despite having savings. Where am I creating artificial scarcity in abundance?”
18. “What wisdom would emerge from complete presence with this?”
Peak experience quality of present-moment awareness. “I’m anxious about the future. What wisdom would emerge from complete presence with this?”
19. “How would I respond from love instead of fear?”
Maslow’s emphasis on love as growth motivator. Transforms perspective instantly. “My teenager is acting out. How would I respond from love instead of fear?”
20. “What patterns am I repeating that worked for survival but limit thriving?”
Maslow’s hierarchy progression insight. AI identifies outdated strategies. “I’m successful but unfulfilled. What patterns am I repeating that worked for survival but limit thriving?”
21. “Where am I judging instead of accepting what is?”
Being-cognition’s non-evaluative awareness. Reduces psychological friction. “I hate my job situation. Where am I judging instead of accepting what is?”
22. “What would integration of my contradictions look like?”
Self-actualized people accept their paradoxes. Pure Maslow wisdom. “I want success and peace simultaneously. What would integration of my contradictions look like?”
23. “How can I serve something larger than myself here?”
Self-transcendence and mission-focused living. Peak experience quality. “I feel purposeless despite career success. How can I serve something larger than myself here?”
24. “What would wholeness feel like in this fragmented situation?”
B-value of wholeness as integration guide. AI helps heal splits. “I feel torn between family and career. What would wholeness feel like in this fragmented situation?”
25. “Where is my potential trying to emerge that I’m not seeing?”
Self-actualization as potential realization. The ultimate growth prompt. “I feel blocked creatively. Where is my potential trying to emerge that I’m not seeing?”
Advanced combo: Stack hierarchy levels. “What basic need is unmet? What would self-actualization look like here? How can I bridge the gap?” Creates complete growth maps.
Secret weapon: Add “Maslow would say…” to any prompt. AI literally channels his humanistic psychology perspective. Surprisingly powerful for reframing problems.
Reality check: Sometimes AI gets too idealistic about human potential. Add “but keep it realistic for someone with normal human limitations” to stay grounded.
I’ve been using these for everything from relationship issues to career pivots. It’s like having a pocket humanistic psychologist who understands your deepest growth edge.
