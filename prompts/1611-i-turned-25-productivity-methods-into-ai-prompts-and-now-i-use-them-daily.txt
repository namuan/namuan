I spent months converting every major productivity system into AI prompts. This is the ultimate arsenal for turning AI into your personal productivity coach:

- Optimizes workflow and reduces switching

- “Group these: email client, buy milk, code review, dentist appointment”

- AI organizes by location/energy type

4. “Design my weekly review process for these areas: [work/personal goals]”

- Creates sustainable planning rhythm

- Customizes review to your life

- Prevents goals from falling through cracks

DEEP FOCUS & SCHEDULING PROMPTS

PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION PROMPTS
9. “What should my Power Hour focus on given these goals: [list goals]”

- Identifies highest-impact morning task

- “Power Hour focus: launching course, improving health, learning Spanish”

10. “Break this overwhelming task into 2-minute steps: [big task]”

- Conquers procrastination through micro-actions

11. “Apply 80/20 analysis to these activities: [list activities]”

- Reveals which tasks actually drive results

- Shows what to delegate or eliminate

- AI ranks by impact vs effort

12. “Categorize these tasks using urgent/important matrix: [list tasks]”

- Classic Eisenhower method via AI

- Creates clear action priorities

HABIT & BEHAVIOR DESIGN PROMPTS
13. “Design a 2-minute version of this habit: [habit goal]”

- Removes resistance to starting

14. “Help me stack this new habit: [new habit] onto this existing one: [current habit]”

- “Stack meditation onto morning coffee”

15. “Design environmental cues for this goal: [goal]”

- Makes good choices automatic

- Removes reliance on willpower

WEEKLY & DAILY PLANNING PROMPTS
16. “Analyze this time log and find inefficiencies: [describe typical week]”

- Reveals unconscious time drains

17. “Plan my ideal week across these areas: [work, health, relationships, growth]”

- Creates balanced schedule template

- AI suggests realistic time allocation

18. “Build white space into this schedule: [packed schedule]”

- Makes busy days actually manageable

19. “Suggest joy moments I can embed in this routine: [describe routine]”

21. “How do I handle this task only once: [describe recurring problem]”

ADVANCED COMBINATION PROMPTS
23. “Design my morning routine using: Power Hour + habit stacking + environmental design”

- AI becomes your calm, organized coach

THE SECRET FORMULA
Stack these prompts like productivity systems stack principles. The magic happens when you combine them:
“Design my Monday using: weekly review insights + Power Hour focus + time-blocking + environmental cues + shutdown ritual”
Pro tip: Add your personality to any prompt: “I’m a perfectionist who procrastinates” or “I get distracted easily but love checking things off lists.”
Reality check: Start with 2-3 prompts max. Productivity systems only work if you actually use them.
Been using this approach for 6 months. It’s like having David Allen, Cal Newport, and James Clear as your personal productivity team, available 24/7.
