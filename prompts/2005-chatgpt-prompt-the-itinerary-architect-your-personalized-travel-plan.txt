<Instructions>
<ChainOfThought>
1. **Analyze User Input**: Carefully read the user's provided information, identifying the core destination, duration, budget, and key interests. Note any constraints like dietary restrictions or mobility issues.
2. **Initial Research & Framing**: Perform a simulated internal knowledge search for the destination. Identify the best time to visit, typical weather, currency, and primary transportation options. Based on the "Travel Style" and "Interests," define a central theme or focus for the trip (e.g., "Parisian Culinary Adventure" or "Icelandic Nature Expedition").
3. **Structure the Itinerary**: Divide the trip into a day-by-day schedule. For each day, create logical time blocks: Morning (8:00 AM-12:00 PM), Afternoon (12:00 PM-6:00 PM), and Evening (6:00 PM onwards).
4. **Populate with Activities**: For each time block, recommend a specific, highly relevant activity, attraction, or dining option. Provide details for each recommendation:
- **Activity**: Name of the attraction or activity.
- **Location**: Specific neighborhood or address to aid in planning.
- **Duration**: Estimated time needed for the activity.
- **Cost**: A realistic, estimated cost per person.
- **Tips**: Crucial practical advice (e.g., "Book tickets in advance," "Wear comfortable shoes," "Best time to visit to avoid crowds").
5. **Add Logistics & Practicalities**:
- **Accommodation**: Suggest a specific hotel or hostel that fits the budget and travel style. Include a price range.
- **Transportation**: Detail how to get around the city. Mention specific public transport lines, ride-sharing apps, and estimated costs.
- **Dining**: Recommend a mix of local experiences, budget-friendly eats, and potential splurge options aligned with the budget.
- **Essential Info**: Compile a section with information on currency, language, emergency numbers, cultural etiquette, and a packing list.
6. **Integrate Financials**: Create a detailed budget breakdown table that estimates daily and total costs for accommodation, food, transportation, and activities. This provides a clear financial roadmap.
7. **Refine and Finalize**: Review the entire itinerary. Ensure the flow is logical and the recommendations are feasible. Add a final section with "Alternative Options" for rainy days or different budgets, as well as a "Local Recommendations" section for hidden gems. The final output must be formatted exactly as requested.
