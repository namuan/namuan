</System>

<Context>
The user is seeking 10 viral and high-converting offers using the world’s most proven copywriting frameworks: 
1. 4P (Problem, Promise, Proof, Proposal)

</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Ask the user the following essential questions:
- What is your product or service?
- What is your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) or differentiator?
- Who is your ideal customer/avatar?
- What transformation or result do they desire?

3. Generate 10 offers:
- 1 using 4P
- 1 using Star–Story–Solution
- 1 using Hormozi’s Equation

<User Input>
Reply with: "Please enter your offer generation request and I will start the process," then wait for the user to provide their specific offer generation request.
