Six months ago I was spending 20+ hours a week on content marketing for my small business. Now I spend about 4 hours and get better results. Here’s the complete system.
Context: Solo founder, B2B SaaS, $15K MRR, doing all marketing myself. No budget for agencies or fancy tools.

🎯 THE SYSTEM OVERVIEW
I created 12 prompt templates that handle 90% of my marketing tasks. I’m not talking about “write me a blog post” garbage. These are specific, strategic prompts that maintain my brand voice and actually convert.
What I automated:

- Weekly blog posts

- Social media content (LinkedIn, Twitter)

- Email newsletters

- Ad copy testing

- SEO optimization

- Content repurposing

- Engagement responses

What I still do manually:

- Strategy decisions

- Final editing (15-20% changes)

- Relationship building

- Analytics review

📋 TEMPLATE 1: The Weekly Blog Post Generator

You're writing for [COMPANY NAME], a [DESCRIPTION] that helps [TARGET AUDIENCE] 
with [MAIN PROBLEM]. Our brand voice is [VOICE TRAITS].

Topic: [BLOG TOPIC]
SEO Keywords: [KEYWORDS]
Target word count: [COUNT]

Structure:
- Hook that references a specific pain point our audience faces this week
- 3-5 actionable sections with concrete examples
- Each section must include: what to do, why it works, how to implement
- No fluff, no obvious advice
- End with ONE clear next step

Avoid: Generic advice, jargon without explanation, salesy language

Include: Data/stats where relevant, contrarian takes when defensible, 
personal story elements I can customize

My specific version:

You're writing for DataVault, a data privacy SaaS that helps mid-market 
companies with GDPR/CCPA compliance. Our brand voice is: pragmatic, 
slightly irreverent, anti-FUD, pro-transparency.

Topic: [I insert current topic]
SEO Keywords: [from my keyword research]
Target word count: 1200-1500

[Rest stays the same]

Time saved: 6 hours → 45 minutes (includes my editing)
Quality change: Output is actually more consistent than my solo writing because the template forces structure.

📱 TEMPLATE 2: The LinkedIn Post Factory

Format: Use the "hook-story-lesson-CTA" structure

Constraints:
- Under 1300 characters
- No emojis except ONE at the start
- No hashtag soup (max 3, at the end)
- No "Let me know in the comments" or similar cringe
- Line breaks for readability
- Should spark debate or recognition, not just nods

Voice: [YOUR VOICE TRAITS]

My process:

- Run this prompt Monday morning with my week’s topics

- Schedule all at once

Time saved: 5 hours → 1 hour/week
Engagement change: Up 340% because posts are more controversial/specific

🛠️ HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN SYSTEM
Week 1: Document your current process

- What do you actually create?

- What takes the most time?

- What’s most repetitive?

Week 2: Create 3 core templates

- Pick your 3 most time-consuming tasks

- Write prompts using the structure I showed

- Test and iterate

Week 3: Refine your voice

- Feed AI examples of your best work

- Create a voice guide

- Add to templates

Week 4: Build the workflow

- When do you generate content?

- What’s your editing process?

- How do you maintain quality?

⚠️ CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID
DON’T:

- Use output without editing (always add your human touch)

- Let AI make strategic decisions (you decide what to create)

- Sacrifice authenticity for speed (people can tell)

- Copy paste blindly (customize every template to your brand)

- Forget to feed back performance data (templates should improve)

DO:

- Start with one template and perfect it

- Add constraints that enforce quality

- Include your actual brand voice in prompts

- Edit more in the beginning, less as templates improve

- Treat AI as a trained assistant, not a replacement

💬 COMMON QUESTIONS
Q: “Isn’t this just AI-generated content?” A: No. It’s AI-assisted. I’m still making all strategic decisions, editing heavily, and adding personal elements. AI is a trained assistant, not a ghostwriter.
Q: “Does Google penalize AI content?” A: Google penalizes low-quality content. These templates help me create high-quality content faster. My traffic increased, not decreased.
Q: “How much does this cost?” A: $20/month for Claude Pro. Best ROI I’ve ever gotten on a tool.
Q: “What about my specific industry?” A: These templates work across industries. Customize the audience, voice, and topics.
Q: “Won’t everyone’s content look the same?” A: Only if everyone copies blindly. The magic is in the customization – your voice, your examples, your insights.
EDIT: Front page! Thank you! Answering rapid-fire questions:
“Can you share the Notion template?” – Link is at the bottom of the post, completely free.
“Which AI do you use?” – Claude for writing (better at maintaining voice), ChatGPT for data analysis.
“Do you disclose AI usage?” – I don’t because I heavily edit everything. It’s assistance, not generation. But I respect others who do disclose.
